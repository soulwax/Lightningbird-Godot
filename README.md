# Lightningbird-Godot

Welcome to the Lightningbird-Godot repository, where cope deluxe meets the power of the Godot Engine 4.2. This project is designed to showcase the capabilities of Godot 4.2 through the development of "Lightningbird," a game that promises to engage and challenge its players with innovative gameplay and stunning visuals.

## Getting Started

To get started with Lightningbird-Godot, you'll need to have Godot 4.2 installed on your system. If you haven't already, download it from the [official Godot website](https://godotengine.org/download).

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository and start exploring the project, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command:

   ```url
   git clone https://github.com/soulwax/Lightningbird-Godot.git
   ```

4. Once the repository is cloned, open the Godot Engine and import the project by navigating to the cloned repository's location and selecting the `project.godot` file.

## Using VS Code with Godot 4.2

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular code editor that can be used to develop Godot projects, offering a rich development environment with a wide array of extensions for enhanced productivity.

### Setting Up VS Code

1. **Install VS Code**: If you haven't installed VS Code, download it from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install Godot Tools Extension**: Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`. Search for "Godot Tools" and install it.

3. **Configure Godot to Use VS Code**: Open Godot Engine, go to `Editor` > `Editor Settings` > `Text Editor` > `External`. Check `Use External Editor` and set the `Exec Path` to the location of your VS Code executable. For `Exec Flags`, use `{project} --goto {file}:{line}:{col}`.

### Working with Godot and VS Code

- **Editing Scripts**: With the Godot Tools extension, you can easily edit your Godot project scripts in VS Code. Just double-click a script in Godot, and it will open in VS Code.

- **Running the Project**: To run your Godot project from VS Code, you can use the Godot Tools extension's built-in functionality. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), type "Godot", and select "Run Godot Project".

- **Debugging**: The Godot Tools extension also supports basic debugging features. Set breakpoints in VS Code, and use the Godot editor to run your project. The game will pause when hitting breakpoints, allowing you to inspect variables and step through code.

## Contributing

Contributions to the Lightningbird-Godot project are welcome! Whether it's submitting bug reports, feature requests, or contributing code, all forms of collaboration help make this project better.

### How can I customize the Godot Tools extension settings in VS Code for a more personalized development experience?

To customize the Godot Tools extension in VS Code for a tailored development experience, follow these steps:

1. **Access Settings**: Open VS Code, and go to `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` (or use the shortcut `Ctrl+,` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+,` on macOS).

2. **Search for Godot Tools**: In the Settings search bar, type "Godot Tools" to filter out the relevant settings.

3. **Customize Your Settings**: You'll see a list of configurable options for the Godot Tools extension, including the Godot executable path, GDScript formatting options, and more. Adjust these settings according to your preferences.

4. **Workspace-Specific Settings**: For project-specific configurations, switch to the "Workspace" tab within the Settings view and repeat the customization process. This ensures that your settings are tailored to the current project.

5. **Edit settings.json**: For more granular control, you can directly edit the `settings.json` file by clicking on the `{}` icon in the top right corner of the Settings tab. Add or modify the Godot Tools-related settings as needed.

### What are some best practices for managing and organizing large Godot projects in VS Code?

Managing and organizing large Godot projects in VS Code efficiently can be achieved by following these best practices:

1. **Structured Directory Layout**: Organize your project files and directories in a logical structure. Common practices include separating assets, scripts, scenes, and other resources into their respective directories.

2. **Use Workspaces**: Utilize VS Code Workspaces to manage multiple related projects under a single window. This is particularly useful for large projects with modular components.

3. **Task Automation**: Leverage the `tasks.json` file in VS Code to automate common tasks such as running the project, exporting builds, or custom scripts for asset processing.

4. **Source Control Integration**: Make use of VS Code's built-in Git support for version control. This helps in tracking changes, branching, and collaborating with other developers.

5. **Extensions for Productivity**: Apart from Godot Tools, install other VS Code extensions that can aid in your development workflow, such as those for code linting, language support, and project navigation.

### Are there any advanced debugging techniques in VS Code that can be particularly useful for Godot game development?

For advanced debugging in Godot game development with VS Code, consider these techniques:

1. **Conditional Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints that are triggered only when a specific condition is met. This is useful for debugging issues that occur under certain circumstances.

2. **Log Points**: Instead of halting execution, log points allow you to log messages to the output console. This is useful for monitoring variables or execution flow without interrupting the game.

3. **Function Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints on function entries. This is particularly useful for debugging specific functions without knowing where they are called from.

4. **Watch Variables**: Use the Watch panel to keep an eye on specific variables and expressions. This is useful for tracking the state of important variables throughout the debugging session.

5. **Remote Debugging**: Configure remote debugging to debug games running on different devices or platforms. This requires setting up the Godot project and VS Code to communicate over the network.

By employing these techniques, you can enhance your debugging capabilities in VS Code, leading to more efficient problem-solving and game development workflows.
